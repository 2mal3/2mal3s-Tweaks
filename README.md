- Not tested with Forge, Bukktit, Spigot and PaperSpigot but probably don't work
- To uninstall run the command `/function #2tw:uninstall`
- The performance of the datapack depends strongly on the activated modules, all modules have a different influence. As long as none is activated, the datapack consumes almost no resources. But normally there should be no noticeable lags on small or medium sized survival worlds.
- The datapack was created with [mc-build](https://github.com/mc-build/mc-build).
