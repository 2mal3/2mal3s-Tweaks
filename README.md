## üìä Bug reports:
I do test my datapack, but I do not find all the bugs. To improve the quality, it helps a lot if you tell me about any bugs you find, so I can fix them. You can do this on the [GitHub](https://github.com/2mal3/2mal3s-Tweaks/issues) website as an issue. To help me better, it would also be handy if you debug the datapack. You can do this by simply run the command
`/function #2mal3:2tw/debug`
and write the displayed message into the bug report.

## üöÄ Performance:
The performance of the datapack depends strongly on the activated modules, all modules have a different influence. As long as none is activated, the datapack consumes almost no resources.
But normally there should be no noticeable lags on small or medium sized survival worlds.

## ‚úÖ Compatibility with other datapacks:
The datapack can be incompatible with datapacks that:
- Use creeper for explosions (conflict with anti_creeper_grief module)
- Modify the player death (conflict with death_chest module and may with death coordinates module)
- Use flying ender eyes (conflict with disabled_ender_eyes module)
- Where the player needs to go verry deep or hight in the world (conflict with end_above_overworld module)
- Assign players to other teams (conflict with invisible_see_invisible module)
- Change the game rules doDaylightCycle, doWeatherCycle, doFireTick and randomTickSpeed (conflict with server_time module)
- Provide Elytras via ways other than End Ships (conflict with nerfed_elytra module)
- Reset enchantment cost of items (conflict with nerfed_elytra module)
- Using wandering traders who are not supposed to be seen (conflict with wandering_trader_notifications module)

However, the datapack should be compatible with other datapacks that follow the [datapack conventions](https://mc-datapacks.github.io/en/).
