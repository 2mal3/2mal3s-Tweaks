Update v1.2.0 (10.6.2021)

With this update the datapack is finally compatible with 1.17. In addition, 5 new modules are added, so that the config menu now gets a second page.
With the new possibilities and things added in 1.17, I also got new ideas for more modules, so a next update will come soon.

Added:
- Armor Stand arms rule
- Bush hiding module
- Projectile block damage module
- Block damage module
- Realistic torches module

Changed:
- Better debug messages
- Improved config menu
  - Added second page for better overview
  - Modules sorted alphabetically
- Compatibility with 1.17
- Lantern Load library updated

Bug fixes:
- Datapack has updated itself all the time

Update v1.1.0 (16.5.2021)

This update only brings 4 new modules for the survival world and a few bug fixes.

Added:
- No to expensive module
- Damage infection module
    - Debug messages
- Random respawn module
- Old regeneration module

Bug fixes:
- With a new datapack version the datapack would update itself constantly
- Spelling mistake fixed
