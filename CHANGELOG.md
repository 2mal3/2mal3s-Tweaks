## Update v1.3.0 (7.9.2021)

Here finally a sign of life from me. My motivation is currently focused on other things, which is why updates will come a bit less often. But I'm still working on the datapacks. So, now to the update.
With this update 6 new modules are added, most of them based on new 1.17 mechanics and items like the glow berries and the spyglass. I also changed the nerfed Elytra module so that you can now enchant the Elytra with unbreaking. The old version was too annoying. 

### Added:
- Glow berries glow module
- End above overworld module
- Unlock all recipes module
- Spyglass selection module
- Spectator sense module
- [Experimental] Death chest module

### Changed:
- Nerfed elytra module made less rigorous
- [Internal] Clearer folder structure

### Bug fixes:
- Anti Creeper grief could sometimes kill players instantly

With this update the datapack is finally compatible with 1.17. In addition, 5 new modules are added, so that the config menu now gets a second page.

### Added:
- Armor Stand arms rule
- Bush hiding module
- Projectile block damage module
- Block damage module
- Realistic torches module

### Changed:
- Better debug messages
- Improved config menu
  - Added second page for better overview
  - Modules sorted alphabetically
- Compatibility with 1.17
- Lantern Load library updated

### Bug fixes:
- Datapack has updated itself all the time
